        <div class="text">Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto (月読尊) or Tsukuyomi (月読), is the moon god in Shinto and Japanese mythology. 
                          The name "Tsukuyomi" is a compound of the Old Japanese words tsuku : <br>
                          (月, "moon, month", becoming modern Japanese tsuki) and yomi (読み, "reading, counting")

        <div class="text">Ryūjin or Ryōjin (龍神, "dragon god"), which in some traditions is equivalent to Ōwatatsumi, was the tutelary deity of the sea in Japanese mythology. <br>
                          This Japanese dragon symbolized the power of the ocean, had a large mouth, and was able to transform into a human shape. <br>
                          He is considered a good god and patron of Japan, since the Japanese population for several centuries lives off the sea and seafood.
