    <!-- A "for loop" is used to repeat a section of code a number of times. for loops are used when
    the number of iterations are known.
    For example:
     For each student in the class (25), provide a grade.
    The for loop repeatedly executes instructions as long as a particular condition is true  -->


    <p id="List_of_Instruments"></p>
    <button onclick="for_Loop()">List of instruments.</button>


    <!-- <p id="List_of_Places"></p>
    <button onclick="for_Loop1()">List of places.</button> -->

    <!-- Id counting to ten is undefined step 179-->

<!-- String length property
        The length property returns the length of a string (number of characters)
        The length of an empty string is 0.
        syntax = string.length
        return value: length of the string-->

        <p>Click the button to return the number of characters in the string "Where is the best place to travel?"</p>

<!-- Arrays are objects and so are included in the object data type.
    objects can have properties(characteristics) and methods (actions)
    arrays are a special type of object.
    Here is how to create an array of cat pictures (our example in the previous step) in JavaScript:-->


<p id="Cat"></p>
    <button onclick="cat_pics()">Cats</button>


<p id="Array"></p>
    <button onclick="array_Function()">Dogs</button>






<!--     
 CONST KEYWORD
 The const keyword creates a constant whose scope can be either global or local to the block in which it is declared.

The name const is slightly misleading because it doesn’t technically create a “constant” (something immutable). Basically, the value assigned by the const keyword is not immutable (it can change) – yet, the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.

Whereas var contains information that is expected to change, const contains information which will never change.

 For example, we’d start by writing our HTML code as follows: -->

 <p id="Constant"></p>
    <Button onclick="constant_function()">Guitar Price</Button>


    

<p id="Return"></p>

<p id="okRock"></p>


<!-- <p>A loop with a break<b>break</b>statement.</p> -->
    <p id=demo1></p>

<!-- <p>A loop with a <b>continue</b> statement.</p>
    <p>A loop which will skip the step where i = 3.</p> -->
<p id="demo"></p>
